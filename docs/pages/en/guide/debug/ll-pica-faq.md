# FAQ

1. Where is the default configuration located for the `linglong.yaml` file generated by `ll-pica`?

   The configuration file for `ll-pica` is located at `~/.pica/config.json`.
2. Does ll-pica fail to convert software such as Wine, Android apps, input methods, or security applications?

   Linglong applications currently do not support this type of application, and consequently, ll-pica cannot convert them either.
3. Why is there no sound from software that requires audio?

   Prompt "libpulsecommon-12.2.so not found" can be addressed by adding a line in the `build` section of the linglong.yaml file: `mv $PREFIX/lib/$TRIPLET/pulseaudio/* $PREFIX/lib/$TRIPLET`.
4. Why is the `command` field empty in the generated `linglong.yaml` file?

   ll-pica retrieves the 'Exec' field from the desktop file within the deb package. If the command is empty, please verify if the desktop file path
   within the deb package exists in the following locations.

   - /opt/apps/$appid/entries/applications
   - /usr/share/applications
