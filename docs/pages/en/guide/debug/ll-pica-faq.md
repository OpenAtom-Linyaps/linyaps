2. Does ll-pica fail to convert software such as Wine, Android apps, input methods, or security applications?

   linyaps applications currently do not support this type of application, and consequently, ll-pica cannot convert them either.

3. Why is there no sound from software that requires audio?

   Prompt "libpulsecommon-12.2.so not found" can be addressed by adding a line in the `build` section of the linglong.yaml file: `mv $PREFIX/lib/$TRIPLET/pulseaudio/* $PREFIX/lib/$TRIPLET`.

4. Why is the `command` field empty in the generated `linglong.yaml` file?

   within the deb package exists in the following locations.
   - /opt/apps/$appid/entries/applications
   - /usr/share/applications
