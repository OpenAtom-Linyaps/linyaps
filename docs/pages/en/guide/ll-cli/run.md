Arguments:
  run                                                run application
  appId                                              application id
```

When the application is installed normally, use the `ll-cli run` command to start it:

```bash
ll-cli run <org.deepin.calculator>
```

By default, executing the run command will start the application of the highest version. If you want to run the application of the specified version, you need to append the corresponding version number after `appid`:

```bash
ll-cli run <org.deepin.calculator/5.7.21.4>
```

By default, `ll-dbus-proxy` is used to intercept and forward `dbus` messages. If you do not want to use `ll-dbus-proxy`, you can use the `--no-proxy` parameter:

```bash
ll-cli run <org.deepin.calculator> --no-proxy
```
If you want to pass file parameters to the app, you can use the `--file` option, and then in the command line parameters, you can use `%%f` to pass the parameters to the specified container to run. The path of the file will be mapped to the container's `/run/host` directory
```bash
ll-cli run <org.deepin.editor> --file /home/deepin/Desktop/test.txt -- %%f
```

If you want to pass url parameters to the app, you can use the `--url` option, and then in the command line parameters, you can use `%%u` to pass the parameters to the specified container to run. if the url is the `file:///` format, The path of the file will be mapped to the container's `/run/host` directory
```bash
ll-cli run <org.deepin.editor> --url file::////home/deepin/Desktop/test.txt -- %%u
```

Use the `ll-cli run` command to enter the specified program container:

```bash
ll-cli run <org.deepin.calculator> --exec /bin/bash
```

After entering, execute `shell` commands, such as `gdb`, `strace`, `ls`, `find`, etc.

Since Linglong applications run in the container, they cannot be directly debugged in the conventional way. You need to run debugging tools in the container, such as `gdb`:

```bash
gdb /opt/apps/org.deepin.calculator/files/bin/deepin-calculator
```

The path is the absolute path of the application in the container.

For more debugging information on Linglong application `release` version, please refer to: [Run FAQ](../debug/faq.md).
