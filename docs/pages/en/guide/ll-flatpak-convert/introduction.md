# ll-flatpak-convert introduction

This tool is provided by the `linglong-pica` package.which provides the ability to convert flatpak packages into Linglong packages, generate the linglong.yaml file required to build Linglong applications, and rely on ll-builder to implement application building and export.

:::tip

The conversion tool is merely an auxiliary tool and does not guarantee
that the converted application will definitely run. It's possible that
the software depends on libraries installed in paths or other
configuration paths that do not align with those inside LingLong's
internal structure, leading to the inability to execute. In such cases,
you would need to use the command `ll-builder run --exec bash` to enter the container for debugging purposes.
