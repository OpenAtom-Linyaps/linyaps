# FAQ

1. Where is the default configuration located for the `linglong.yaml` file generated by `ll-pica`?

   The configuration file for `ll-pica` is located at `~/.pica/config.json`.
2. Does ll-pica fail to convert software such as Wine, Android apps, input methods, or security applications?

   Linglong applications currently do not support this type of application, and consequently, ll-pica cannot convert them either.
3. Why is there no sound from software that requires audio?

   Prompt "libpulsecommon-12.2.so not found" can be addressed by adding a line in the `build` section of the linglong.yaml file: `mv $PREFIX/lib/$TRIPLET/pulseaudio/* $PREFIX/lib/$TRIPLET`.
