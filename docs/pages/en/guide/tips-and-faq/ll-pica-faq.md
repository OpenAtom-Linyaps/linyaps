# Common Issues

1. Where is the default configuration for the linglong.yaml file generated by ll-pica?

   The ll-pica configuration file is located at `~/.pica/config.json`.

2. Can ll-pica convert Wine, Android, input method, or security software?

   Linyaps applications currently do not support these types of applications, and ll-pica cannot convert them either.

3. Why does software that needs audio have no sound?

   If you get a "not found libpulsecommon-12.2.so" error, you can add a line in the build field of the linglong.yaml file: `mv $PREFIX/lib/$TRIPLET/pulseaudio/* $PREFIX/lib/$TRIPLET`.

4. Why is the command field empty in the generated linglong.yaml file?

   ll-pica obtains the Exec field by reading the desktop file in the deb package. If the command is empty, please check if the desktop file path in the deb package is in one of the following paths:
   - /opt/apps/$appid/entries/applications
   - /usr/share/applications
